# Digit Recognizer with Custom Neural Network

This project is a digit recognition system built around my previous neural network implementation. It includes a fully functional **handwritten digit classifier** trained on the **MNIST dataset**.

## Features
- 🧠 **Custom-built neural network** 
- 🔄 **Training from scratch** using backpropagation.
- ✍ **Handwriting input** with a **WinForms-based UI**.
- 📊 **Live loss visualization** using ScottPlot.
